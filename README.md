# Imprint CMS

This is deprecated and unsupported, and probably not very useful anymore.

In 2001, I wrote a CMS for [Imprint](http://uwimprint.ca/), the University of Waterloo student newspaper. It replaced the previous publishing "system," a set of Perl scripts run on exports from Adobe PageMaker.

This system has been replaced a few times. As of December 2017, Imprint currently runs on WordPress.
